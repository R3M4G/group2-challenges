Lets make a poem! Add a line in the poem by your own imagination :3

I'll start -

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Thats why yo mama,
doesn't love you,
When the beat drops,
Raindrops, drop tops
We had no reason to cry,
Until our city went dry 
All we can do is try,
yo!! yo!!




ah shit here we go again!
We live for the creed,
So we can create new breed
i dont like to boast
but i love my toast

by amar-belkhede
Shattered soul, tattered mind.
The way back is what I hope to find.
Broken dreams lost without a trace.
Lately I've been feeling a little out of place.

are bhai bhai bhai!!!
with everything having a fry
Until our city went dry,
Dont look too close,Its dark inside
